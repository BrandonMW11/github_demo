# Overview

In order to facilitate a consistent series of training materials for use by the new members of the robotics team, a set of training modules is being created.

# Philosophy

- Learning by doing.  GitHub itself will be used to distribute and illustrate the concepts expected to be used by the programming teams.

- Modular.  The ability to review and redo a module is to be supported.  The content necessary to participate in a module will be provided.
